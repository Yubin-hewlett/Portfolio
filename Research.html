<p>W3Schools website where we can find many stuffs such as JAVA, CSS, PYTHON, HTML and others languages which are required for the programmers as well as the normal
students. W3Schools is optimized for learning, testing, and training.</p>
<p>W3Schools is a web developers site, with tutorials and references on web development languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and JQuery, covering most aspects of web programming.
The site derives its name from the World Wide Web (W3), but is not affiliated with the W3C.
W3Schools was originally created in 1998, by Refsnes Data, a Norwegian software development and consulting company.</p>

<p>Another website called Code Academy is very useful for the web developer because it gives detail information about the code and helps us to improve our learning qualities. By the help of this website over 45 million 
people are getting knowledge all over the world. In Code Academy there are separate courses for each topic: you might start out with Make a Website or Learn HTML & CSS, and progress to JavaScript, SQL, and more.

<p>I learnt website designing on YouTube more than other websites and journals. Below link is where i have learnt about the designing of the navigation bar which is required for the website 
for making the website looks attractive and easy for the users. The following video i watched is only for navigation bar and which looks similar, but the other concept such as; Pages, Hover effect, Footer and other stuffs
are built by researching the journals, websites etc. But the easy way to learn the website is none other than the website called YouTube.
In here we can easily understand what the code actually does. The YouTuber provides each and every knowledge about the code and justifies it.</p>
